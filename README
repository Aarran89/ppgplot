This is the Python pgplot extension written by Nick Patavalis. 
This version has minor mods from Scott Ransom and Tom Marsh.

Installation:

You must have pgplot, python and 'numpy' installed. A difficult
issue that the pgplot and numpy must have been compiled with the
same type of fotran compiler e.g. either g77/g95 or gfortran.
If pgplot is compiled with g77/g95 but numpy with gfortran, things
won't work.

Then type:

python setup.py install --prefix=top_level_install_directory

If no prefix, then it will go to the standard location but you
will have to be root. 

I have started on documentation, but only a few have been done.
Most routines have the same call as standard pgplot, but sometimes
the number of points does not appear, e.g. pgline becomes

pgline(x,y)

because the x,y numpy arrays contain the number of points. However,
this is not consistently applied and if in doubt, you should look at the 
C interface code.

Access what documentation there is using 'pydoc ppgplot'
